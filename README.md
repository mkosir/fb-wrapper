# fb-wrapper

## Highly opinionated Facebook API client for Node.js

This is a small heavily opinionated utility wrapper library around [facebook-node-sdk](https://github.com/node-facebook/facebook-node-sdk).  
It is implemented with facade pattern which translates facebook-node-sdk library's existing interface into simplified one.
